``There is a secret doctrine:
outside of love, the most sacred thing a person can give is labor.
And somehow, along the way, we tend to forget that.
Labor is a very precious thing that you have.
Any time you can combine labor with love, you’ve made a merger.
And I think we’re going to win tomorrow.''

James Carville (1992)
